## workout-tracker

## Description

In this project I created a fitness tracker to help others like myself keep better track of our workouts in order to meet our fitness goals. 

This project allowed me to test out my knowledge in Mongodb and Express.

## Installations
Run npm i

For this project express, mongoose, and morgan were used.
